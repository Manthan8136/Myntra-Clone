A portfolio serves as your professional showcase, acting as a dynamic resume that goes beyond a list of qualifications. It's a curated collection of your best work, demonstrating your practical skills and passion for technology. For a BCA student, it bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world application. By including projects like your Myntra clone, you prove your ability to build and style functional web pages. It highlights your problem-solving skills, creativity, and dedication to continuous learning. Ultimately, a strong portfolio makes a memorable first impression, helping you stand out to potential employers and collaborators.
